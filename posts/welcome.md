Welcome to my tech guides. This is a place I created to share the information I've gathered that I thought might help others.

One of the things I enjoy most is building something of value. Towards that end, technology provides the ability to deliver value at a low-cost to a broad audience. It covers my current technology focus on mobile and web applications built using the React framework.

It ended up being that and more.
