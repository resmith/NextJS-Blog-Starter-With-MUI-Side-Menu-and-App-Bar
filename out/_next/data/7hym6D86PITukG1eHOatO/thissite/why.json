This site was built out of necessity. I like to take notes for myself and wanted to share them with others in the hopes that they would be beneficial. I started taking notes HTML but it was too limited. For instance, there was no method for one page to easily include other pages.\n\nReact is a step above HTML, but it requires hand coding the content within the React format, while better seemed to be too complex and error prone for novices. There are content management systems, which are great for more sizeable sites, but I was looking for something simpler but with flexibility that allowed the user to focus on creating content.\n\n\n## Why not use HTML?\nWith HTML I was spending too much time on the formatting and not enough time on the content.   Something that focused on the writing was needed.\n\nWhat the content would look like coding in HTML\n![HTML](why-not-html.webp)\n\nIn comparison, markdown is simpler to write and easier to read.\n![HTML](markdown-example.webp)\n\n\n## What this application provides\nThis tool was created to be flexible but opinionated. It's opinionated to allow the content creator to focus on the content and spend minimal time on configuration and non-content administration. This application provides an easy way to create content within directories, allowing the content creator to decide the directory structures. What it requires is that site structure is consistent for both the content directories and images. \n","slug":["thissite","why"],"blogDir":"thissite"},"__N_SSG":true}
