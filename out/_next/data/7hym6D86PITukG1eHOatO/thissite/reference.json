This what gives the application the ability to dynamically create route paths based on the content.\n\nThe code for this is in the file /pages/[...slug].js\n\n[Dynamic routing / Catch-all Routes](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/dynamic-routes/dynamic-routes-details)\n\n## Gray Matter\nThis application uses gray matter to pull the meta-information from the head of the file. For example, it pulls from the file ** How.md **\n\n![Gray-Matter](how-gray-matter.webp)\n\nprovides to the application the JSON object:\n\n```json\n  {\n    data: {\n      title: 'How to use this code'\n      author: Robert Smith\n      date: '2020-08-18T07:00:00.000Z'\n      blog_image:\n    },\n    content: 'This page shows you how to use this code to create your own blog.'\n  }\n```\n\nwhich is used in the layout component\n![Layout Header](Layout-headerData.webp)\n\n[Gray Matter - NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter)\n\n[Gray Matter - Git Source](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter)\n  \n\n## React Markdown\nReact Markdown is used to pull in markdown files and render them as HTML.\n\n\n\n[React Markdown - NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown)\n\n[React Markdown - Demo](https://rexxars.github.io/react-markdown/)\n\n[React Markdown - Git](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown#readme)\n\n**Note**\nThis application assumes the source of the files is known and safe. Because of this it allows HTML tages to be rendered. If this is not the case, then in the layout component, set *escapeHtml={false}*\n```HTML\n<ReactMarkdown\n  source={markdown}\n  escapeHtml={false}\n/>\n```\n\n\n","slug":["thissite","reference"],"blogDir":"thissite"},"__N_SSG":true}
